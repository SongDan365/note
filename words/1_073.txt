Lesson 73 The way to King Street
Listen to the tape then answer this question.
Why did the man need a phrasebook?
Last week Mrs. Mills went to London.
She does not know London very well, and she lost her way.
Suddenly, she saw a man near a bus stop.
"I can ask him the way," she said to herself.
"Excuse me." she said.
"Can you tell me the way to King Street, please?"
The man smiled pleasantly.
He did not understand English!
He spoke German.
He was a tourist.
Then he put his hand into his pocket, and took out a phrasebook.
He opened the book and found a phrase.
He read the phrase slowly.
"I am sorry." he said.
"I do not speak English."
