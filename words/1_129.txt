Lesson 129 Seventy miles an hour
Listen to the tape then answer this question.
What does Ann advise her husband to do next time?
Look, Gary!
That policeman's waving to you.
He wants you to stop.
Where do you think you are?
On a race track?
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.
I can't have been.
I was doing eighty when I overtook you.
Didn't you see the speed limit?
I'm afraid I didn't, officer.
I must have been dreaming.
He wasn't dreaming, officer.
I was telling him to drive slowly.
That's why I didn't see the sign.
Let me see your driving licence.
I won't charge you this time.
But you'd better not do it again!
Thank, you.
I'll certainly be more careful.
I told you to drive slowly, Gary.
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.
Well, next time you'd better take my advice!
