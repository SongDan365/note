Lesson 125 Tea for two
Listen to the tape then answer this question.
Does Susan have tea by herself?
Can you come in and have tea now, Peter?
Not yet.
I must water the garden first.
Do you have to water it now?
I'm afraid I must.
Look at it!
It's terribly dry.
What a nuisance!
Last summer it was very dry, too.
Don't you remember?
I had to water it every day.
Well, I'll have tea by myself.
That was quick!
Have you finished already?
Yes.
Look out of the window.
It's raining!
That means you don't need to water the garden.
That was a pleasant surprise.
It means I can have tea, instead.
