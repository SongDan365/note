1. to take them with me，把它们带上。
   them 指 “两本词典”。

2. The lady who is standing behind the counter.
   who is standing behind the counter 是一个以关系代名 who 引导的定语从句，用来修饰前面的名词 the lady。
   本课带有定于从句的复合句还有: The books which are on the counter; He says he's the man who bought these books; The man who I served was wearing a hat; Is this the man that you served 等，
   其中 which, who, that 均为关系代名词。

3. The man who I served was wearing a hat.
   这是另一个定语从句的例子。由于被修饰的名词 the man 在定语从句中是动词 served 的宾语，因此，关系代名应该用宾语 whom，但在口语中往往用主格who。
