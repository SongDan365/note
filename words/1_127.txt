Lesson 127 A famous actress
Listen to the tape then answer this question.
Who is only twenty-nine, and why is it so unclear?
Can you recognize that woman, Liz?
I think I can, Kate.
It must be Karen Marsh, the actress.
I thought so.
Who's that beside her?
That must be Conrad Reeves.
Conrad Reeves, the actor?
It can't be.
Let me have another look.
I think you're right!
Isn't he her third husband?
No.
He must be her fourth or fifth.
Doesn't Karen Marsh look old?
She does, doesn't she!
I read she's twenty-nine, but she must be at least forty.
I'm sure she is.
She was a famous actress when I was still at school.
That was a long time ago, wasn't it?
Not that long ago!
I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.

1. 在 It must be Karen Marsh ... 这一句中，must be 是英文中用来表示根据事实所作的推论，往往译为 “一定”。
   must be 的否定式是 can't be, 如 Kate 的话 "It can't be." 是对 Liz 的推论("That must be Conrad Reeves.")的否定。
   同时，请注意这里的 can't be (表示不可能) 和第45课中 I can't type this letter. (表示能力) 的区别。

2. Who's that beside her?
   本句中 that 是指人。

3. her fourth or fifth 后面省略了 husband。

4. Not that long ago!
   句中的 that 是副词，指像 Kate 所说的 “那么” 遥远，可译作 “那样”、“那么”。
   课文中用斜体印刷表示一种强调，显然 Liz 对 Kate 的判断和对她本人年龄的估算很不满意。
