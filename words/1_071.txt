1. He telephoned me for times yesterday. 他昨天给我打了 4 次电话。be 动词以外的动词在过去时中一般有两种形式。
   规则动词一般是在动词后面加 ed，如 answer / answered；以 e 结尾的规则动词加 d，如 telephone / telephoned，arrive / arrived。
   另一部分动词的过去式拼写不规则，因此称为不规则动词，如 say / said，do / did。

2. 一般过去式的句子中常常有表示过去某一时刻的时间状语，如本课中的 yesterday, the day before yesterday, yesterday morning, yesterday afternoon, yesterday evening, last night。
